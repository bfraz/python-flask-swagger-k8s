FORKED from rest_api_demo
=========================


IMPORTANT:
The code of this demo app was written by Michal Karzynski, described in this blog:
http://michal.karzynski.pl/blog/2016/06/19/building-beautiful-restful-apis-using-flask-swagger-ui-flask-restplus/
https://github.com/postrational/rest_api_demo


THIS is exclusively to demo swagger/api on k8s. It does not abide by best practices with external configuration, etc, etc.
AGAIN. THIS DOESN'T LEVERAGE best practice for deployable on k8s. Merely to demonstrate a point.

If you would like to run this elsewhere, update the `FLASK_SERVER_NAME` in settings.py
